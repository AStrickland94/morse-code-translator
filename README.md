# Morse Code Translator

A project to make a two-way translator between latin characters and morse code using JavaScript.

## Goals

My goal is to make a working translator site that will translate between latin characters (A-Z etc) and morse code. The functionality will be created using HTML, SCSS and JavaScript.

## MVP

1. Create a user interface that allows the user to either input some English text or some Morse Code
2. Create JS functions that would allow the user to translate their English text into Morse Code or Morse Code into English text
3. Make sure to handle spaces properly (ie. there is 1 space between English words, but one space between Morse Code characters)

## Roadblocks

Trying to filter invalid characters from the text. (Resolved by returning an error character)
